Task is to write a function that takes necessary inputs and divides the array into 2 section which are called
winter and summer. Write a function:

That, given a sequence T of temperature measurements (specified as integer numbers), finds the
partition of the year into winter and summer that meets the conditions such that it would be met. Conditions are:
    * Divide the year into winter (array) and summer (array) so that winter comes before summer
    and each winter temperature is smaller than the any temperature measured in the summer.
    * Make winter as short as possible, then returns the length of the winter.
    * Both winter and summer have to be at least one day long.
    * In case of there are many possible division of the initial array, take the one where winter is
    as short as possible.
    * You can assume that there are solutions to mentioned division where at least one partition that
satisfies this condition.

For example, given:
T = [5, -2, 3, 8, 6]
The function should return 3, as after partitioning the year into winter: [5, -2, 3] and summer: [8, 6],
each winter’s measurement is smaller than each summer’s temperature.

On the other hand, for the following array:
T = [-5, -5, -5, -42, 6, 12]

The function should return 4. The partition that minimize the length of the winter is [-5, -5,-5,-42]
and [6, 12]. Winter could also have length 5, but the function should return the shortest possible
winter.

Assume that:
* N is an integer within the range [2 .. 300,000];
* Each element of array T is an integer within the range [-1,000,000,000 .. 1,000,000,000];
* There will be at least one correct way to divide the year into winter and summer.
